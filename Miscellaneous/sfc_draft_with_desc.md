### \[Start]

**Description:** Entry point. Triggers initialization of the orchestration framework.

```
[Start]

   v
```

---

### 1. Main Idea Initialization

**Node:** Main Idea

* **Action:** Initialize the LangGraph/Agno orchestration engine.
* **Details:**

  * Load global configurations (API keys, service endpoints, tuning parameters).
  * Establish session context for user and system (unique session ID, timestamps).
* **Human Interaction:** No direct user involvement; this is a backend setup step.

```
+------------------------------+
|         Main Idea           |   <- Initialize orchestration via LangGraph/Agno
|  "Emotion-Aware Multimodal  |
|        Memory Chatbot"      |
+------------------------------+
```

### 2. Emotion Detection Agent

**Node:** Emotion Detection Agent

* **Action:** Perform real-time audio processing to detect user speech and emotional cues.
* **Sub-Processes:**

  1. **Voice Activity Detection (VAD):** Segment incoming audio to isolate speech segments.
  2. **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Transcribe the segmented audio into text.
  3. **Paralinguistic Analysis:** Extract features such as pitch, tone, volume, and speaking rate.
  4. **Emotion Classification:** Classify the user's emotional state (e.g., calm, anxious, frustrated) using an LLM or specialized classifier.
* **Human Interaction:** Captures user voice; the user begins interaction through speech.

```
+------------------------------+
|   Emotion Detection Agent    |   <- STT + VAD feed into emotion classifier
+------------------------------+
```

---

### 3. Multimodal Memory Tagging

**Node:** Multimodal Memory Tagging

* **Action:** Store both transcriptions and emotional metadata into the long-term memory store (vector database).
* **Sub-Processes:**

  1. **Feature Extraction:** Convert text and emotion labels into embedding vectors.
  2. **Tagging:** Attach metadata (timestamp, emotion label, confidence score).
  3. **Storage:** Persist embeddings in a scalable vector store (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone).
* **Human Interaction:** No direct; the system passively logs the user’s input and emotional context.

```
+------------------------------+
| Multimodal Memory Tagging    |   <- Tag transcripts & emotions in vector DB
+------------------------------+
```

---

### 4. Iterative Empathy Loop

**Node:** Iterative Empathy Loop

* **Action:** After generating each response, monitor subsequent user replies to assess whether the emotional state has shifted.
* **Sub-Processes:**

  1. **Sentiment Check:** Analyze the next user utterance (via STT/VAD) for sentiment/emotion drift.
  2. **Loop Decision:** If the user's emotional state remains unchanged or degrades, trigger an empathy refinement.
  3. **Empathy Refinement:** Adjust response strategy—use more reassuring language or simplify explanations.
* **Human Interaction:** Continuous; user responses drive the loop.

```
+------------------------------+
|   Iterative Empathy Loop     |   <- Check next user reply sentiment
+------------------------------+
```

---

### 5. Specialized Multi-Agent Pipeline

**Node:** Specialized Multi-Agent Pipeline

* **Action:** Decompose user intent into distinct tasks and dispatch to dedicated agents.
* **Sub-Processes:**

  * **Task Decomposition:** Break down the user’s request into sub-tasks (e.g., symptom extraction, medical advice, empathy response).
  * **Agent Dispatch:** Assign each sub-task to a specialized LLM-based agent.
* **Human Interaction:** Indirect; user sees faster, modular responses but no direct node involvement.

```
+------------------------------+
| Specialized Multi-Agent      |   <- Orchestrator decomposes tasks
|         Pipeline             |
+------------------------------+
```

---

### 6. Task Decomposition & Sub-Agents

**Node:** Task Decomposition

* **Action:** Parse the user’s intent and identify which sub-agents need to run.
* **Outputs:** A list of sub-agents to execute and their respective inputs.

```
+------------------------------+

|  • Parse intent              |
|  • Identify sub-tasks        |
+------------------------------+
      |           |           |
      v           v           v
```

#### 6a. Extract Symptoms Agent

* **Action:** Identify and normalize reported symptoms from the transcript.
* **Human Interaction:** User’s descriptions fuel this agent.

```
+-----------------------------+
|   Extract Symptoms Agent    |
+-----------------------------+
```

#### 6b. Medical Retrieval Agent

* **Action:** Retrieve relevant medical knowledge (guidelines, drug info, differential diagnoses) using RAG techniques.
* **Human Interaction:** None direct; supports the quality of responses.

```
+-----------------------------+
|   Medical Retrieval Agent   |
+-----------------------------+
```

#### 6c. Empathy Response Agent

* **Action:** Generate the human-facing reply, blending clinical content with empathetic tone based on detected emotional state.
* **Human Interaction:** The user reads and reacts to this response.

```
+-----------------------------+
|  Empathy Response Agent     |
+-----------------------------+
```

---

### 7. Orchestrated Context Sharing

**Node:** Orchestrated Context Sharing

* **Action:** Merge outputs from all sub-agents, assemble the final response, and update the working memory (short-term context).
* **Sub-Processes:**

  1. **Result Aggregation:** Combine symptom list, medical facts, and empathetic language.
  2. **Context Update:** Append the exchange to session-level working memory for use in the next turn.
* **Human Interaction:** None direct; ensures coherent conversation.

```
+------------------------------+
| Orchestrated Context Sharing |   <- Merge outputs, maintain working memory
+------------------------------+
```

### 8. Responsive Error Handling

**Node:** Responsive Error Handling

* **Action:** Detect potential errors or hallucinations and invoke fallback mechanisms.
* **Sub-Processes:**

  1. **Hallucination Detector:** Check LLM outputs against medical knowledge base thresholds.
  2. **Fallback Trigger:** If inconsistencies arise, route to a simplified Question & Answer agent or ask clarifying follow-up questions.
* **Human Interaction:** The user may answer clarifying questions, guiding the system back on track.

```
+------------------------------+
| Responsive Error Handling    |   <- Detect hallucinations, ask follow-up questions
+------------------------------+
      |
      v
+-----------------------------+
|   Fallback Q&A Agent        |
+-----------------------------+
      |
